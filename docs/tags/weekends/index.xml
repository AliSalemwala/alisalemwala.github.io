      <description>I finally did it. I genuinely spent a whole Sunday doing nothing, and feeling no guilt over it. Not an easy feat.
Friday was nice. A bar, a cute girl with a boyfriend, getting lost in a farm.
Saturday was fun. Waking up to a phone call at noon, my guy asking for his jacket back from the night before. Regret and confusion for everything that happened. An introduction to a ski course at some crazy guy&amp;rsquo;s home, out in the boondocks.</description>
