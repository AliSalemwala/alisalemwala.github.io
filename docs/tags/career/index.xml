      <description>##Getting Recruited
The money is in tech, and so is the freedom. I have friends working in other fields, being pushed around by power-tripping assholes for a pittance of wages. In tech, the power-tripping assholes have to pay you a lot of money, and you only get pushed around in Zoom calls you take from sunny beaches while you work remotely. This spoils you, and I want all my friends to be as spoilt as I&amp;rsquo;ve become, so I&amp;rsquo;ve taken to telling everybody I meet to join the tech industry, agriculture and the arts be damned.</description>
