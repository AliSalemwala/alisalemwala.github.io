      <description>This should be one long saga.
My body has embarrassed me all my life. I&amp;rsquo;ve fantasized about being Jacked &amp;amp; Tanâ„¢ since my prepubescent days. I gathered the courage to accompany a couple of my other chump friends when I was around 14, I&amp;rsquo;d say. It was pathetic. I then fantasized for a couple more years, until I was 16 or 17. After that, I went pretty regularly (all in secret, of course), and plodded along following whatever nonsense the trainer there told me to do.</description>
