			<description>I finally did it. I genuinely spent a whole Sunday doing nothing, and feeling no guilt over it. Not an easy feat.
Friday was nice. A bar, a cute girl with a boyfriend, getting lost in a farm.
Saturday was fun. Waking up to a phone call at noon, my guy asking for his jacket back from the night before. Regret and confusion for everything that happened. An introduction to a ski course at some crazy guy&amp;rsquo;s home, out in the boondocks.</description>
			<content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I finally did it. I genuinely spent a whole Sunday doing nothing, and feeling no guilt over it. Not an easy feat.</p>
<p>Friday was nice. A bar, a cute girl with a boyfriend, getting lost in a farm.</p>
<p>Saturday was fun. Waking up to a phone call at noon, my guy asking for his jacket back from the night before. Regret and confusion for everything that  happened. An introduction to a ski course at some crazy guy&rsquo;s home, out in the boondocks. Then, a vaporizer pen. Active noise cancellation headphones. <em>Faces</em> by Mac Miller blasting. Get lost again. Bother the shit out of everybody. Sorry, Faaiz.</p>
<p>A comedy show called <em>Homecoming</em> by Hasan Minhaj watched at midnight in the afterglow of the vape gone by. I don&rsquo;t usually like these ABCD comedians, but there was something sweet about watching this guy. My son will probably be like him.</p>
<p>Come Sunday morning. Jerked awake by a bad dream. I yelled at some guy, and him and his meathead friends beat up my little brother. I wasn&rsquo;t there to do anything. There&rsquo;s a girl my brother was flirting with who is crying just looking at him, all covered in bruises. She begs me to do something, it was my fault. I run around trying to find them. I find them later at a car crash, all dead except for the main culprit. He&rsquo;s fucking huge, and now I&rsquo;m gonna get my ass kicked too. Or I just go all out and try to kill him with the broken glass. I come awake, still unable to think of a better solution.</p>
<p>There is no afterglow now, only stress. Pace a bit, let it wash away. Let&rsquo;s get back to reality.</p>
<p>Home alone. Heater turned up to toasty, snuggled up on the couch in the hallway, pillows and blankets around me. There&rsquo;s no way to actually know what time it is. Comfy sweatshirt and sweatpants on. Socks, too. No tough guy shit today.</p>
<p>Brushing your teeth is the biggest thing. Don&rsquo;t shower, that&rsquo;s negotiable, but if you don&rsquo;t brush, you will be depressed for the rest of the day. So I brush. Check the time, I&rsquo;m super early.</p>
<p>Fuck it, that dream was awful. I need a break. Today I&rsquo;m staying a little smelly, a little chill, and a little happy. I mean, I&rsquo;ll try, at least.</p>
<p>Still lying back on the couch, pillow on my lap, laptop on the pillow, fire up <em>Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind</em>. I saw it before, around a decade ago. Nothing made sense, for some reason. I was unsatisfied. This time I&rsquo;m sad. It&rsquo;s a sad movie. What is a relationship? What is a memory? What is erasure? What are the humiliations we run from? What are the dark corners of memory we bring our partners into, trying to intertwine our minds with theirs? What is sweetness? What are the forgotten smiles, locked away behind gates of bitterness? What are the mysteries behind the ripped out pages in our notebooks? What is that gray looming sadness that takes over our lives? The whole movie is a mix of the dearest and the damnedest of memories that live in us, polluting and populating every waking second. Think about the first time you met someone special. Think about the last. Think about every moment in between. The good and the terrible. Let it all just wash over you. Feels like a relaxing bath at Guantanamo Bay.</p>
<p>Movie is over, but this is not one to end on. It is way too cerebral, way too emotional. It&rsquo;s also way too early. I&rsquo;ll have to be productive after this. But I can&rsquo;t jump into something too light directly. There needs to be a bridge. I am two levels above existence.</p>
<p><em>Stranger than Fiction</em>. Another film from a decade ago, when I was doing anything to escape reality. Another film I know I liked deep down, but couldn&rsquo;t fully get. Even if I did, I don&rsquo;t remember now.</p>
<p>My housemate comes home in the middle of the movie, but leaves again in a bit. I keep watching. A subdued performance about a subdued man, who is counting away his life, living in numbers. A robot, seemingly bred specially for the IRS. That is, until he begins to hear the voice narrating his existence, and announcing his death. He fights to stay alive, and discovers a reason to as a result. A reason more than just numbers. Second movie of the day about <strong>finding love, not avoiding it™</strong>. The movie is calm, with no sudden changes, no sudden movements. We spend our time in bakeries and a professor&rsquo;s office. The robot finds love. The question arises, are we seizing life? Are we happy with everything? What happened to all the things we never did? I am floating on clouds. I feel like I&rsquo;m in my mother&rsquo;s arms again.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;m still one level above existence. I need to come back down. <em>Upstarts</em>. An Indian movie about three friends making a startup. The dialog, though a little wooden at times, sounds exactly like how actual Desis talk. Feels like home. Startup dreams are also obviously very close to heart, an object of daily fantasy for me and every monkey around me. The plot is predictable, with sprinklings of <em>Badmash Company</em> and <em>Silicon Valley</em> noticeable everywhere. The movie also rushes by way too fast, and cannot decide what it wants to focus on. The cliché good-guys-win ending became obvious 30 minutes before the film ended, but it was a good way to come back down to Level 0. Back to earth.</p>
<p>Time to clean my room and write this down. Clear up the skill-backlog, too. It&rsquo;s nice sometimes to go a few levels higher. I should probably go find love soon. The movie I related to most was the one about an asshole trying to get rich at any cost.</p>

			<description>This should be one long saga.
My body has embarrassed me all my life. I&amp;rsquo;ve fantasized about being Jacked &amp;amp; Tan™ since my prepubescent days. I gathered the courage to accompany a couple of my other chump friends when I was around 14, I&amp;rsquo;d say. It was pathetic. I then fantasized for a couple more years, until I was 16 or 17. After that, I went pretty regularly (all in secret, of course), and plodded along following whatever nonsense the trainer there told me to do.</description>
			<content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This should be one long saga.</p>
<p>My body has embarrassed me all my life. I&rsquo;ve fantasized about being <em>Jacked &amp; Tan</em>™ since my prepubescent days. I gathered the courage to accompany a couple of my other chump friends when I was around 14, I&rsquo;d say. It was pathetic. I then fantasized for a couple more years, until I was 16 or 17. After that, I went pretty regularly (all in secret, of course), and plodded along following whatever nonsense the trainer there told me to do. He was waiting for me to pay him extra to get a little of that good advice, but little did he know I was too shy to greet him properly. How the hell was I going to negotiate a training session?</p>
<p>Disclaimer: I am not ashamed or embarrassed of anything anymore, and if I had been like that since the day I was born, I wouldn&rsquo;t be sitting here writing this stupid post. The best thing you can do is stop being shy, as soon as possible.</p>
<p>I then went off to Turkey at age 18. Here I went very regularly. I also went hard. I also stopped asking anybody for tips and just did it. This worked for me, because I had over the past half-decade built up a reservoir of exercise knowledge that would make a savant jealous. I just never acted on it.</p>
<p>I followed Starting Strength for a while, the only difference being I went every day instead of M-W-F. I got bored soon, and it wasn&rsquo;t stressing my body enough, so I added a bunch of accessory work. This template, I never really dropped since.</p>
<p>When I was 19 or 20, my knee was fucking up bad. I had a friend of mine check me out while squatting, and he said my knee movement was whack, which was fucking it all up. Luckily for me, I was young, dumb, and full of cum so I just took a short break (by short I mean like two days) and jumped back into it, slowly building up to my old weight, but this time with correct knee placement. I&rsquo;ve literally never had a single knee problem after then, but I have always been unfairly lucky. Be super paranoid about form in the beginning. Once that mind-muscle connection is established, you can loosen up a bit and follow your gut more.</p>
<p>As for food, I ate a lot by volume, but in terms of calories and such, I was barely touching the bar. That explains why I had the strength of Hercules, with the size of an Indian coolie at the railway station. Both of those are direct quotes, by the way. One guy said my strength was &ldquo;Herculean&rdquo;, and another said I looked like some colonial farmhand. Not bad, but nobody would say Arnold was colonised, and I don&rsquo;t want anyone saying it to me.</p>
<p>It did hamper me, though. Calories and macros are important. A cucumber does not have the same number of calories as a steak. It has barely anything. Measure your TDEE, try to go to the gym hard, and increase or decrease your caloric intake from the TDEE to get the results you want.</p>
<p>Now I definitely made routines that were way too ambitious. This happened because I would go HAM for months on end, build up to a point where my body was a machine, then <em>Party &amp; Bullshit</em>™ for an even greater amount of months, and piss everything away. And when I started again, I was of course not about to stop going HAM. Problem was, my body physically could not handle that. I wasted many weeks running in this stupid hamster wheel.</p>
<p>Lesson: Keep track of different iterations of routines. Keep a basic one for when you&rsquo;re getting back in. And keep a mid-level one for when you&rsquo;re in the groove again. I never got to an elite level where I really needed advanced programming to keep track of what I was doing, so I can&rsquo;t advise on that. Follow the routines online, they are way better than anything I can tell you.</p>
<p>Remember me comparing the cucumber and the steak above? Well, in 2020 I had a big steady income because of my job, and I had shaken off my obsessive aversion to spending money. In other words, I was finally okay with eating chicken every day (not every meal, though). Three months of that had me looking like Adonis again, after fucking up my body during the lockdown months. Diet and HAM are the real combo.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m in Germany now, and it&rsquo;s the second-last day of September as I finish this sentence. I&rsquo;ve been here since mid-June, and unfortunately my body just didn&rsquo;t hit that sexy level despite hitting the three-month mark. I blame it on hobbies, socializing, commuting, trying too hard to set up a &ldquo;diet&rdquo;, and - in true German fashion - on beer and Kräuterlikör.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to close this on one note: You need time to recover. Even I do, and I&rsquo;m apparently supposed to be some sort of colonial-era Hercules. When I used to go to the gym almost daily for months at a time, I would sometimes be forced to take a week gap for this reason or that, and when I returned to the gym after that, my strength would have popped like the pussy I was smashing in those week-long sabbaticals.</p>
<p>So, instead of pouring one out for all that deceased vag, I&rsquo;m going to adjust my routine. Tentatively, it&rsquo;s going to be 3 weeks of my <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1wAM6_stNP9vqcdMm46UnOvDwywKlY7j4lZvMCmLBTm4/edit?usp=sharing">personal 6-day variant</a> of <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/37ylk5/a_linear_progression_based_ppl_program_for/">Metallicdpas' PPL</a>, and then one week of a <a href="https://thefitness.wiki/routines/5-3-1-for-beginners/">Beginner 5/3/1</a>.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s see how it goes.</p>

			<title>Reading</title>

			<description>Don&amp;rsquo;t ask me what reading is because I don&amp;rsquo;t know. Over the past two and almost-a-half decades of my life, it was a lot of different things to me.
Reading is a gleaming bubble of soap you can sink into, when the world around you is a heap of stinking sewage. The smell doesn&amp;rsquo;t hit you, the filth doesn&amp;rsquo;t reach you, and the flies buzzing around melt into the sound of the blood pounding in your ears.</description>

<p>Reading is a gleaming bubble of soap you can sink into, when the world around you is a heap of stinking sewage. The smell doesn&rsquo;t hit you, the filth doesn&rsquo;t reach you, and the flies buzzing around melt into the sound of the blood pounding in your ears.</p>
<p>Reading is a virtual-reality headset you can wear, specifically tailored to your beautiful, inexperienced neurons. It&rsquo;s the next-best thing to actually being there.</p>
<p>Reading is a spaceship you can climb into, that will take you to the stars. The alien conductor can then announce on the spaceship speakerphone that it&rsquo;s now okay to look back down at your life. That&rsquo;s a view you&rsquo;ll never get when you&rsquo;re down there.</p>
<p>Reading is a mirror you can look into, and instead of seeing disappointment, you can be met with hope - or fantasy, depending on your level of cynicism.</p>
<p>Reading is a round-table conference of thorough geniuses, shouting at you until their voices go hoarse, usually drowned out by a cacophony of thoroughly mediocre minds, shouting louder still.</p>
<p>Reading is a boy you meet at school that you never fall out with, or fall for. He develops as you develop, he thinks as you think, and there is no schoolyard group to slide its tentacles in between.</p>
<p>If you got this far, reading is you wondering why I act so tough but think so sensitive.</p>
<hr>
<p>Writing, on the other hand, is awful. Writing is a reminder you will never be as good as the best.</p>
<hr>
<p>What is the point of it all, though? I scroll through recommendations on GoodReads, a website I just got into, and I&rsquo;m met with a barrage of familiar names.</p>
<p>I read all these different books. I spent hours poring over them, in countries over the world, zoning out the dozen other languages being spoken around me, in every conceivable setting. I used to hold 1000-page books out in front of me (old school: before audiobooks, the internet, or e-readers), and walk down the street with my face buried in deep, expecting the world to part for me, like a nerdy Moses. And it did.</p>
<p>And now what of them do I remember? Did they help? I have no data, I have no idea.</p>
<p>Sure, if I sit next to a cute girl, I can flex. &ldquo;I roughed it all throughout the Wild American West. I defended Albania from the Ottomans. I fought for Biafra&rsquo;s independence. I crossed the border from India to Pakistan in &lsquo;47. I left a trail of babies in the Dominican Republic. I meditated with the Buddha. I was even abandoned on Mars. I&rsquo;ve been everywhere, you dumb bitch. So what if I&rsquo;m blind without my glasses and have the second-worst passport in the world?&rdquo;</p>
<p>After her, what then? I&rsquo;m back alone, scrolling through the list. No idea what to read, no idea where to go. Books are the buckets I used to make my brain overflow with wisdom and knowledge, right? Not a time-pass. Not some empty activity. Definitely not a fucking identity like some people have made it.</p>
<p>Books are tools. Just tools. I don&rsquo;t know how best to use these tools, but perhaps writing down a few words about everything I read will help me stay refreshed years down the line. They would have been helpful in rating Oliver Twist on GoodReads, at least.</p>
<p>Now, to think about how our changing nature over time means even the same book is never really the same&hellip; Oh, and if you&rsquo;re wondering what was the point of all this, there was no point. That&rsquo;s why it ends so abruptly.</p>

			<description>Turkey: I lived here from August 2015 to May 2021. I started out as a university student on a strict self-appointed budget, and transitioned into an extremely highly paid professional without any budget really, but with a focus on remaining economical wherever possible. What this means is, I started to enjoy myself and indulge in little (and sometimes not so little) pleasures. On the whole, however, I did not move onto luxury.</description>

<p>I lived here from August 2015 to May 2021. I started out as a university student on a strict self-appointed budget, and transitioned into an extremely highly paid professional without any budget really, but with a focus on remaining economical wherever possible. What this means is, I started to enjoy myself and indulge in little (and sometimes not so little) pleasures. On the whole, however, I did not move onto luxury.</p>
<p>My biggest regret for my university years is the obsession I had with conserving every penny. This cost me numerous opportunities of all kinds, and I guess I’ll never fully know what I missed out on; it’s entirely possible I didn’t miss out on anything, but that wouldn&rsquo;t pacify the pessimist in me. One piece of advice, don’t save money just to save it. Have a plan for what it will be used for, and if you can’t plan anything for it then spend it on something you’ll enjoy “in the now”. Misery is not a virtue. Get it?</p>
<p>My biggest regrets for my short-lived time of luxury are:</p>
<ol>
<li>Not having enough time to blow the cash I was getting (COVID-19 started a month after I got my first baller salary), and</li>
<li>Not managing a budget to see where my money went, even though it made absolutely no difference to me.</li>
</ol>
<p>I’d suggest keeping a budget, if not for the money then at least just to see where it all goes. It can give you a good sense of direction, priorities, and inefficiencies.</p>
<p>Anyway, the reason I’m writing up the Turkish section now is because I’ve been in Munich over three weeks now, made my way through the discounters and Turkish shops here, talked to a few locals, and have conclusively decided my diet will be in for big changes. It’s best to let the Turkish version go now, and note it down here before it leaves my mind.</p>
<p>I usually bought my food from BIM or A-101, because they were the cheapest stores close to my home. Vegetables and fruits, I purchased from Soykan because it had a good balance of freshness, quality, and price. Everyday I ate the same thing, and saw good results, fast. Combined with a rigorous gym routine, you’ll notice improvements fast.</p>
<p>The items in the graph represent raw ingredients, and were usually combined into meals based on what was logical and convenient at the time. I don’t have records of the macros exactly, but all of my requirements were satisfied. Fruits and vegetables, of course, depended on the season.</p>

<p>Total calories: <strong>3014</strong></p>
<p>I’m around 173 cm and to gain weight and muscle fast, this is a pretty good diet. Low in saturated fats and empty calories. High in fiber. Great protein content. Enough carbohydrates to keep your energy up. Hits every segment of vitamins, minerals, and all that other stuff. No processed foods. High in volume so you stay full for a long time. Nothing is processed, no sweets, no fake Nestle “fruit juices”. Adaptable, and easy to prepare.</p>
<p>This was also during COVID and work-from-home, by the way, so I was just attending meetings while I had my mercimek boiling in the background, or chicken baking in the oven, or oats soaking in honey and milk. I didn’t need to constantly be in the kitchen cooking, is what I mean. That’s something I’ve been struggling with in Germany so far, but let’s see what the future holds.</p>
<p>That’s it for Turkey. I haven’t got my German diet down to a science yet; I’m facing some challenges there, but that’s to be expected. It’s still better than my American diet of canned beans and corn and gallons of milk, at least. This is fun, I hope I can do it for many more countries to come.</p>
<h1 id="germany">Germany</h1>
<p>I have been here for three months now (today is 19 September 2021). Not enough time to really set up a perfect diet, but I want to note down some findings.</p>
<p>Red meat is crazy cheap here, so I went wild with it for a while, in the beginning. And I&rsquo;m not sure if it was all the bratwurst, or the terrible face wash, but my skin would not stop breaking out into pimples. I got rid of both, and it&rsquo;s all back to beauty now. German diets are very calorie dense (sausages, heavy bread, butter, beer) and I think this might come in handy with eating the same amount, while physically eating less. The problem is, this just leaves less wiggle room in the diet, and requires stricter adherence to routine, since these foods are very fat-heavy.</p>
<p>In Turkey, meat was nonexistent in my diet, and chicken only came in as an addition years into this process. In Germany, there were days when the only thing I ate was red meat. On those days, I felt very slow and heavy, and I also noticed my weight growing faster than my strength (i.e. I was getting fat). The discussion then became between red meat cuts, sausages, hackfleisch, and chicken.</p>
<p>After some weeks of experimentation, and a little insight into the kind of lifestyle I wanted, I came to the conclusion that it didn&rsquo;t make sense to keep the rigid diet I had in Turkey. I&rsquo;m not as stingy as I was in university, nor as content with my friends as I was upon graduation, nor as trapped as I was during the COVID lockdowns. These are the days again of experimentation and exploration. Dozens of new people to meet, new places to see, new hobbies to keep up.</p>
<p>Up until now, it makes sense to limit meats to at most one meal a day, and to standardize the foods that I can have regularly. This will consider foods provided in the office, foods which are more environmentally friendly, and foods which are better for my skin.</p>

			<title>Making This</title>

			<description>Making something like this is as simple as it looks. There were a few things I wrestled with, mainly GitHub submodules, but I ended up getting through. I&amp;rsquo;ll explain them further down, both for your sake and my own. I know I&amp;rsquo;ll forget it all in a week.
Note: It has been exactly 8 weeks since I wrote that note above. I still have not completed this post. I remember absolutely nothing from when I first made it.</description>
			<content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Making something like this is as simple as it looks. There were a few things I wrestled with, mainly GitHub submodules, but I ended up getting through. I&rsquo;ll explain them further down, both for your sake and my own. I know I&rsquo;ll forget it all in a week.</p>
<p><em>Note</em>: It has been exactly 8 weeks since I wrote that note above. I still have not completed this post. I remember absolutely nothing from when I first made it.</p>
<h1 id="step-1">Step 1</h1>
<p>I&rsquo;m hosting this on <a href="https://pages.github.com/">Github Pages</a>. For this, I need to create a repository called <em>alisalemwala.github.io</em>. Everything is automatically hosted from there. Keep it all lowercase, otherwise it won&rsquo;t work. Everything before <em>.github.io</em> should be your GitHub username in lowercase, no more, no less.</p>
<h1 id="step-2">Step 2</h1>
<p>I&rsquo;m on a Mac, so I have those stupid <em>.DS_STORE</em> files everywhere. Need to create a <em>.gitignore</em> file to ignore them. <code>Commit</code></p>
<h1 id="step-3">Step 3</h1>
<p>I need to create the actual Hugo project now. Run this anywhere:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">hugo new site demo
</code></pre></div><p>There&rsquo;s now a new <em>demo</em> folder with empty hugo configurations. Copy the contents of this to the <em>alisalemwala.github.io</em> folder. That&rsquo;s an empty website. <code>Commit</code></p>
<h1 id="step-4">Step 4</h1>
<p>I need to connect submodules. I don&rsquo;t remember why. I need to read about it again and add it here. I do know that it&rsquo;s to add the theme somehow. For <strong>Hermit</strong>:</p>
<pre><code>git submodule add https://github.com/Track3/hermit.git themes/hermit
</code></pre><p>There should be a <em>themes</em> folder, with another <em>hermit</em> folder inside it. That&rsquo;s the submodule. <code>Commit</code></p>
<h1 id="step-5">Step 5</h1>
<p>I need to specify which directory the files are published from. This is where Hugo autogenerates the files to display. The <em>docs</em> folder. So go to <em>config.toml</em> and add these in new lines:</p>
<pre><code>baseURL = &quot;https://alisalemwala.github.io/&quot;
publishDir = &quot;docs&quot;
</code></pre><p>This should finalise your basic configuration. To test this, run:</p>
<pre><code>hugo server
</code></pre><p>Visit whichever port on localhost where this is deployed (1313 for me) and click around to see if everything is okay. Now build:</p>
<pre><code>hugo -D
</code></pre><p>Everything is built! <code>Commit</code> and if you wait for the GitHub pipeline to finish, you should be able to visit your version of <a href="https://alisalemwala.github.io/">https://alisalemwala.github.io/</a> and see the same things you saw on localhost.</p>
<h1 id="step-6">Step 6</h1>
<p>I&rsquo;ve got another step in my notes which says to copy everything from the <em>exampleSite</em> folder inside the <em>hugo</em> theme file and re-run <code>hugo -D</code>. I don&rsquo;t know why I did any of this. I also added a note that submodules halted my progress a lot. I remember using a workaroud for them in the beginning, just to see the site working at least. Based on the commit history, it seems I got them working later, but I can&rsquo;t be sure. I need to see if this is actually a step, or just some confused notes.</p>
<h1 id="step-7">Step 7</h1>
<p>I need to add a post. Run:</p>
<pre><code>hugo new posts/making-this.md
</code></pre><p>THe post is created. Edit the contents in Markdown to get the content you want. In the header, change the <code>draft</code> property to <code>false</code>. Run <code>hugo -D</code> to create the requisite files. <code>Commit</code></p>

<h2 id="move-static-content-to-static">Move static content to <code>static</code></h2>
<p>Jekyll has a rule that any directory not starting with <code>_</code> will be copied as-is to the <code>_site</code> output. Hugo keeps all static content under <code>static</code>. You should therefore move it all there.
With Jekyll, something that looked like</p>
<pre><code>▾ &lt;root&gt;/
    ▾ images/
        logo.png
</code></pre>
<p>should become</p>
<pre><code>▾ &lt;root&gt;/
    ▾ static/
        ▾ images/
            logo.png
</code></pre>
<p>Additionally, you&rsquo;ll want any files that should reside at the root (such as <code>CNAME</code>) to be moved to <code>static</code>.</p>
<h2 id="create-your-hugo-configuration-file">Create your Hugo configuration file</h2>
<p>Hugo can read your configuration as JSON, YAML or TOML. Hugo supports parameters custom configuration too. Refer to the <a href="/overview/configuration/">Hugo configuration documentation</a> for details.</p>
<h2 id="set-your-configuration-publish-folder-to-_site">Set your configuration publish folder to <code>_site</code></h2>
<p>The default is for Jekyll to publish to <code>_site</code> and for Hugo to publish to <code>public</code>. If, like me, you have <a href="http://blog.blindgaenger.net/generate_github_pages_in_a_submodule.html"><code>_site</code> mapped to a git submodule on the <code>gh-pages</code> branch</a>, you&rsquo;ll want to do one of two alternatives:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Change your submodule to point to map <code>gh-pages</code> to public instead of <code>_site</code> (recommended).</p>
<pre><code> git submodule deinit _site
 git rm _site
 git submodule add -b gh-pages git@github.com:your-username/your-repo.git public
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>
<p>Or, change the Hugo configuration to use <code>_site</code> instead of <code>public</code>.</p>
<pre><code> {
     ..
     &quot;publishdir&quot;: &quot;_site&quot;,
     ..
 }
</code></pre>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="convert-jekyll-templates-to-hugo-templates">Convert Jekyll templates to Hugo templates</h2>
<p>That&rsquo;s the bulk of the work right here. The documentation is your friend. You should refer to <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/docs/templates/">Jekyll&rsquo;s template documentation</a> if you need to refresh your memory on how you built your blog and <a href="/layout/templates/">Hugo&rsquo;s template</a> to learn Hugo&rsquo;s way.</p>
<p>As a single reference data point, converting my templates for <a href="http://heyitsalex.net/">heyitsalex.net</a> took me no more than a few hours.</p>
<h2 id="convert-jekyll-plugins-to-hugo-shortcodes">Convert Jekyll plugins to Hugo shortcodes</h2>
<p>Jekyll has <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/docs/plugins/">plugins</a>; Hugo has <a href="/doc/shortcodes/">shortcodes</a>. It&rsquo;s fairly trivial to do a port.</p>
<h3 id="implementation">Implementation</h3>
<p>As an example, I was using a custom <a href="https://github.com/alexandre-normand/alexandre-normand/blob/74bb12036a71334fdb7dba84e073382fc06908ec/_plugins/image_tag.rb"><code>image_tag</code></a> plugin to generate figures with caption when running Jekyll. As I read about shortcodes, I found Hugo had a nice built-in shortcode that does exactly the same thing.</p>
<p>Jekyll&rsquo;s plugin:</p>
<pre><code>module Jekyll
  class ImageTag &lt; Liquid::Tag
    @url = nil
    @caption = nil
    @class = nil
    @link = nil
    // Patterns
    IMAGE_URL_WITH_CLASS_AND_CAPTION =
    IMAGE_URL_WITH_CLASS_AND_CAPTION_AND_LINK = /(\w+)(\s+)((https?:\/\/|\/)(\S+))(\s+)&quot;(.*?)&quot;(\s+)-&gt;((https?:\/\/|\/)(\S+))(\s*)/i
    IMAGE_URL_WITH_CAPTION = /((https?:\/\/|\/)(\S+))(\s+)&quot;(.*?)&quot;/i
    IMAGE_URL_WITH_CLASS = /(\w+)(\s+)((https?:\/\/|\/)(\S+))/i
    IMAGE_URL = /((https?:\/\/|\/)(\S+))/i
    def initialize(tag_name, markup, tokens)
      super
      if markup =~ IMAGE_URL_WITH_CLASS_AND_CAPTION_AND_LINK
        @class   = $1
        @url     = $3
        @caption = $7
        @link = $9
      elsif markup =~ IMAGE_URL_WITH_CLASS_AND_CAPTION
        @class   = $1
        @url     = $3
        @caption = $7
      elsif markup =~ IMAGE_URL_WITH_CAPTION
        @url     = $1
        @caption = $5
      elsif markup =~ IMAGE_URL_WITH_CLASS
        @class = $1
        @url   = $3
      elsif markup =~ IMAGE_URL
        @url = $1
      end
    end
    def render(context)
      if @class
        source = &quot;&lt;figure class='#{@class}'&gt;&quot;
      else
        source = &quot;&lt;figure&gt;&quot;
      end
      if @link
        source += &quot;&lt;a href=\&quot;#{@link}\&quot;&gt;&quot;
      end
      source += &quot;&lt;img src=\&quot;#{@url}\&quot;&gt;&quot;
      if @link
        source += &quot;&lt;/a&gt;&quot;
      end
      source += &quot;&lt;figcaption&gt;#{@caption}&lt;/figcaption&gt;&quot; if @caption
      source += &quot;&lt;/figure&gt;&quot;
      source
    end
  end
end
Liquid::Template.register_tag('image', Jekyll::ImageTag)
</code></pre>
<p>is written as this Hugo shortcode:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;!-- image --&gt;
&lt;figure {{ with .Get &quot;class&quot; }}class=&quot;{{.}}&quot;{{ end }}&gt;
    {{ with .Get &quot;link&quot;}}&lt;a href=&quot;{{.}}&quot;&gt;{{ end }}
        &lt;img src=&quot;{{ .Get &quot;src&quot; }}&quot; {{ if or (.Get &quot;alt&quot;) (.Get &quot;caption&quot;) }}alt=&quot;{{ with .Get &quot;alt&quot;}}{{.}}{{else}}{{ .Get &quot;caption&quot; }}{{ end }}&quot;{{ end }} /&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;!-- image --&gt;

<h3 id="usage">Usage</h3>
<p>I simply changed:</p>
<pre><code>{% image full http://farm5.staticflickr.com/4136/4829260124_57712e570a_o_d.jpg &quot;One of my favorite touristy-type photos. I secretly waited for the good light while we were &quot;having fun&quot; and took this. Only regret: a stupid pole in the top-left corner of the frame I had to clumsily get rid of at post-processing.&quot; -&gt;http://www.flickr.com/photos/alexnormand/4829260124/in/set-72157624547713078/ %}
</code></pre>
<p>to this (this example uses a slightly extended version named <code>fig</code>, different than the built-in <code>figure</code>):</p>
<pre><code>{{% fig class=&quot;full&quot; src=&quot;http://farm5.staticflickr.com/4136/4829260124_57712e570a_o_d.jpg&quot; title=&quot;One of my favorite touristy-type photos.

</code></pre>
<p>As a bonus, the shortcode named parameters are, arguably, more readable.</p>
<h2 id="finishing-touches">Finishing touches</h2>
<h3 id="fix-content">Fix content</h3>
<p>Depending on the amount of customization that was done with each post with Jekyll, this step will require more or less effort. There are no hard and fast rules here except that <code>hugo server --watch</code> is your friend. Test your changes and fix errors as needed.</p>
<h3 id="clean-up">Clean up</h3>
<p>You&rsquo;ll want to remove the Jekyll configuration at this point. If you have anything else that isn&rsquo;t used, delete it.</p>

<h2 id="hugo-template-primer">Hu(go) Template Primer</h2>
<p>Hugo uses the excellent <a href="https://golang.org/">Go</a> <a href="https://golang.org/pkg/html/template/">html/template</a> library for
its template engine. It is an extremely lightweight engine that provides a very
small amount of logic. In our experience that it is just the right amount of
logic to be able to create a good static website. If you have used other
template systems from different languages or frameworks you will find a lot of
similarities in Go templates.</p>
<p>This document is a brief primer on using Go templates. The <a href="https://golang.org/pkg/html/template/">Go docs</a>
provide more details.</p>
<h2 id="introduction-to-go-templates">Introduction to Go Templates</h2>
<p>Go templates provide an extremely simple template language. It adheres to the
belief that only the most basic of logic belongs in the template or view layer.
One consequence of this simplicity is that Go templates parse very quickly.</p>
<p>A unique characteristic of Go templates is they are content aware. Variables and
content will be sanitized depending on the context of where they are used. More
details can be found in the <a href="https://golang.org/pkg/html/template/">Go docs</a>.</p>
<h2 id="basic-syntax">Basic Syntax</h2>
<p>Golang templates are HTML files with the addition of variables and
functions.</p>
<p><strong>Go variables and functions are accessible within {{ }}</strong></p>
<p>Accessing a predefined variable &ldquo;foo&rdquo;:</p>
<pre><code>{{ foo }}
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Parameters are separated using spaces</strong></p>
<p>Calling the add function with input of 1, 2:</p>
<pre><code>{{ add 1 2 }}
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Methods and fields are accessed via dot notation</strong></p>
<p>Accessing the Page Parameter &ldquo;bar&rdquo;</p>
<pre><code>{{ .Params.bar }}
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Parentheses can be used to group items together</strong></p>
<pre><code>{{ if or (isset .Params &quot;alt&quot;) (isset .Params &quot;caption&quot;) }} Caption {{ end }}
</code></pre>
<h2 id="variables">Variables</h2>
<p>Each Go template has a struct (object) made available to it. In hugo each
template is passed either a page or a node struct depending on which type of
page you are rendering. More details are available on the
<a href="/layout/variables">variables</a> page.</p>
<p>A variable is accessed by referencing the variable name.</p>
<pre><code>&lt;title&gt;{{ .Title }}&lt;/title&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>Variables can also be defined and referenced.</p>
<pre><code>{{ $address := &quot;123 Main St.&quot;}}
{{ $address }}
</code></pre>
<h2 id="functions">Functions</h2>
<p>Go template ship with a few functions which provide basic functionality. The Go
template system also provides a mechanism for applications to extend the
available functions with their own. <a href="/layout/functions">Hugo template
functions</a> provide some additional functionality we believe
are useful for building websites. Functions are called by using their name
followed by the required parameters separated by spaces. Template
functions cannot be added without recompiling hugo.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
<pre><code>{{ add 1 2 }}
</code></pre>
<h2 id="includes">Includes</h2>
<p>When including another template you will pass to it the data it will be
able to access. To pass along the current context please remember to
include a trailing dot. The templates location will always be starting at
the /layout/ directory within Hugo.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
<pre><code>{{ template &quot;chrome/header.html&quot; . }}
</code></pre>
<h2 id="logic">Logic</h2>
<p>Go templates provide the most basic iteration and conditional logic.</p>
<h3 id="iteration">Iteration</h3>
<p>Just like in Go, the Go templates make heavy use of range to iterate over
a map, array or slice. The following are different examples of how to use
range.</p>
<p><strong>Example 1: Using Context</strong></p>
<pre><code>{{ range array }}
    {{ . }}
{{ end }}
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Example 2: Declaring value variable name</strong></p>
<pre><code>{{range $element := array}}
    {{ $element }}
{{ end }}
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Example 2: Declaring key and value variable name</strong></p>
<pre><code>{{range $index, $element := array}}
    {{ $index }}
    {{ $element }}
{{ end }}
</code></pre>
<h3 id="conditionals">Conditionals</h3>
<p>If, else, with, or, &amp; and provide the framework for handling conditional
logic in Go Templates. Like range, each statement is closed with <code>end</code>.</p>
<p>Go Templates treat the following values as false:</p>
<ul>
<li>false</li>
<li>0</li>
<li>any array, slice, map, or string of length zero</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Example 1: If</strong></p>
<pre><code>{{ if isset .Params &quot;title&quot; }}&lt;h4&gt;{{ index .Params &quot;title&quot; }}&lt;/h4&gt;{{ end }}
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Example 2: If -&gt; Else</strong></p>
<pre><code>{{ if isset .Params &quot;alt&quot; }}
    {{ index .Params &quot;alt&quot; }}
{{else}}
    {{ index .Params &quot;caption&quot; }}
{{ end }}
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Example 3: And &amp; Or</strong></p>
<pre><code>{{ if and (or (isset .Params &quot;title&quot;) (isset .Params &quot;caption&quot;)) (isset .Params &quot;attr&quot;)}}
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Example 4: With</strong></p>
<p>An alternative way of writing &ldquo;if&rdquo; and then referencing the same value
is to use &ldquo;with&rdquo; instead. With rebinds the context <code>.</code> within its scope,
and skips the block if the variable is absent.</p>
<p>The first example above could be simplified as:</p>
<pre><code>{{ with .Params.title }}&lt;h4&gt;{{ . }}&lt;/h4&gt;{{ end }}
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Example 5: If -&gt; Else If</strong></p>
<pre><code>{{ if isset .Params &quot;alt&quot; }}
    {{ index .Params &quot;alt&quot; }}
{{ else if isset .Params &quot;caption&quot; }}
    {{ index .Params &quot;caption&quot; }}
{{ end }}
</code></pre>
<h2 id="pipes">Pipes</h2>
<p>One of the most powerful components of Go templates is the ability to
stack actions one after another. This is done by using pipes. Borrowed
from unix pipes, the concept is simple, each pipeline&rsquo;s output becomes the
input of the following pipe.</p>
<p>Because of the very simple syntax of Go templates, the pipe is essential
to being able to chain together function calls. One limitation of the
pipes is that they only can work with a single value and that value
becomes the last parameter of the next pipeline.</p>
<p>A few simple examples should help convey how to use the pipe.</p>
<p><strong>Example 1 :</strong></p>
<pre><code>{{ if eq 1 1 }} Same {{ end }}
</code></pre>
<p>is the same as</p>
<pre><code>{{ eq 1 1 | if }} Same {{ end }}
</code></pre>
<p>It does look odd to place the if at the end, but it does provide a good
illustration of how to use the pipes.</p>
<p><strong>Example 2 :</strong></p>
<pre><code>{{ index .Params &quot;disqus_url&quot; | html }}
</code></pre>
<p>Access the page parameter called &ldquo;disqus_url&rdquo; and escape the HTML.</p>
<p><strong>Example 3 :</strong></p>
<pre><code>{{ if or (or (isset .Params &quot;title&quot;) (isset .Params &quot;caption&quot;)) (isset .Params &quot;attr&quot;)}}
Stuff Here
{{ end }}
</code></pre>
<p>Could be rewritten as</p>
<pre><code>{{  isset .Params &quot;caption&quot; | or isset .Params &quot;title&quot; | or isset .Params &quot;attr&quot; | if }}
Stuff Here
{{ end }}
</code></pre>
<h2 id="context-aka-the-dot">Context (aka. the dot)</h2>
<p>The most easily overlooked concept to understand about Go templates is that {{ . }}
always refers to the current context. In the top level of your template this
will be the data set made available to it. Inside of a iteration it will have
the value of the current item. When inside of a loop the context has changed. .
will no longer refer to the data available to the entire page. If you need to
access this from within the loop you will likely want to set it to a variable
instead of depending on the context.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
<pre><code>  {{ $title := .Site.Title }}
  {{ range .Params.tags }}
    &lt;li&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;{{ $baseurl }}/tags/{{ . | urlize }}&quot;&gt;{{ . }}&lt;/a&gt; - {{ $title }} &lt;/li&gt;
  {{ end }}
</code></pre>
<p>Notice how once we have entered the loop the value of {{ . }} has changed. We
have defined a variable outside of the loop so we have access to it from within
the loop.</p>
<h1 id="hugo-parameters">Hugo Parameters</h1>
<p>Hugo provides the option of passing values to the template language
through the site configuration (for sitewide values), or through the meta
data of each specific piece of content. You can define any values of any
type (supported by your front matter/config format) and use them however
you want to inside of your templates.</p>
<h2 id="using-content-page-parameters">Using Content (page) Parameters</h2>
<p>In each piece of content you can provide variables to be used by the
templates. This happens in the <a href="/content/front-matter">front matter</a>.</p>
<p>An example of this is used in this documentation site. Most of the pages
benefit from having the table of contents provided. Sometimes the TOC just
doesn&rsquo;t make a lot of sense. We&rsquo;ve defined a variable in our front matter
of some pages to turn off the TOC from being displayed.</p>
<p>Here is the example front matter:</p>
<pre><code>---
title: &quot;Permalinks&quot;
date: &quot;2013-11-18&quot;
aliases:
  - &quot;/doc/permalinks/&quot;
groups: [&quot;extras&quot;]
groups_weight: 30
notoc: true
---
</code></pre><p>Here is the corresponding code inside of the template:</p>
<pre><code>  {{ if not .Params.notoc }}
    &lt;div id=&quot;toc&quot; class=&quot;well col-md-4 col-sm-6&quot;&gt;
    {{ .TableOfContents }}
    &lt;/div&gt;
  {{ end }}
</code></pre>
<h2 id="using-site-config-parameters">Using Site (config) Parameters</h2>
<p>In your top-level configuration file (eg, <code>config.yaml</code>) you can define site
parameters, which are values which will be available to you in chrome.</p>
<p>For instance, you might declare:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-yaml" data-lang="yaml"><span class="nt">params</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="w">
</span><span class="w">  </span><span class="nt">CopyrightHTML</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="s2">&#34;Copyright &amp;#xA9; 2013 John Doe. All Rights Reserved.&#34;</span><span class="w">
</span><span class="w">  </span><span class="nt">TwitterUser</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="s2">&#34;spf13&#34;</span><span class="w">
</span><span class="w">  </span><span class="nt">SidebarRecentLimit</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="m">5</span><span class="w">
</span></code></pre></div><p>Within a footer layout, you might then declare a <code>&lt;footer&gt;</code> which is only
provided if the <code>CopyrightHTML</code> parameter is provided, and if it is given,
you would declare it to be HTML-safe, so that the HTML entity is not escaped
again.  This would let you easily update just your top-level config file each
January 1st, instead of hunting through your templates.</p>
<pre><code>{{if .Site.Params.CopyrightHTML}}&lt;footer&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;text-center&quot;&gt;{{.Site.Params.CopyrightHTML | safeHtml}}&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/footer&gt;{{end}}
</code></pre><p>An alternative way of writing the &ldquo;if&rdquo; and then referencing the same value
is to use &ldquo;with&rdquo; instead. With rebinds the context <code>.</code> within its scope,
and skips the block if the variable is absent:</p>
<pre><code>{{with .Site.Params.TwitterUser}}&lt;span class=&quot;twitter&quot;&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/{{.}}&quot; rel=&quot;author&quot;&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/images/twitter.png&quot; width=&quot;48&quot; height=&quot;48&quot; title=&quot;Twitter: {{.}}&quot;
 alt=&quot;Twitter&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;{{end}}
</code></pre><p>Finally, if you want to pull &ldquo;magic constants&rdquo; out of your layouts, you can do
so, such as in this example:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;nav class=&quot;recent&quot;&gt;
  &lt;h1&gt;Recent Posts&lt;/h1&gt;
  &lt;ul&gt;{{range first .Site.Params.SidebarRecentLimit .Site.Recent}}
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;{{.RelPermalink}}&quot;&gt;{{.Title}}&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  {{end}}&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/nav&gt;

<h2 id="step-2-build-the-docs">Step 2. Build the Docs</h2>
<p>Hugo has its own example site which happens to also be the documentation site
you are reading right now.</p>
<p>Follow the following steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Clone the <a href="http://github.com/spf13/hugo">Hugo repository</a></li>
<li>Go into the repo</li>
<li>Run hugo in server mode and build the docs</li>
<li>Open your browser to http://localhost:1313</li>
</ol>
<p>Corresponding pseudo commands:</p>
<pre><code>git clone https://github.com/spf13/hugo
cd hugo

<p>The best way to learn something is to play with it.</p>
<h2 id="creating-a-new-theme">Creating a New Theme</h2>
<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>This tutorial will show you how to create a simple theme in Hugo. I assume that you are familiar with HTML, the bash command line, and that you are comfortable using Markdown to format content. I&rsquo;ll explain how Hugo uses templates and how you can organize your templates to create a theme. I won&rsquo;t cover using CSS to style your theme.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll start with creating a new site with a very basic template. Then we&rsquo;ll add in a few pages and posts. With small variations on that, you will be able to create many different types of web sites.</p>
<p>In this tutorial, commands that you enter will start with the &ldquo;$&rdquo; prompt. The output will follow. Lines that start with &ldquo;#&rdquo; are comments that I&rsquo;ve added to explain a point. When I show updates to a file, the &ldquo;:wq&rdquo; on the last line means to save the file.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s an example:</p>
<pre><code>## this is a comment
$ echo this is a command
this is a command

## edit the file
$ vi foo.md
+++
date = &quot;2014-09-28&quot;
title = &quot;creating a new theme&quot;
+++

bah and humbug
:wq

## show it
$ cat foo.md
+++
date = &quot;2014-09-28&quot;
title = &quot;creating a new theme&quot;
+++

bah and humbug
$
</code></pre><h2 id="some-definitions">Some Definitions</h2>
<p>There are a few concepts that you need to understand before creating a theme.</p>
<h3 id="skins">Skins</h3>
<p>Skins are the files responsible for the look and feel of your site. It’s the CSS that controls colors and fonts, it’s the Javascript that determines actions and reactions. It’s also the rules that Hugo uses to transform your content into the HTML that the site will serve to visitors.</p>
<p>You have two ways to create a skin. The simplest way is to create it in the <code>layouts/</code> directory. If you do, then you don’t have to worry about configuring Hugo to recognize it. The first place that Hugo will look for rules and files is in the <code>layouts/</code> directory so it will always find the skin.</p>
<p>Your second choice is to create it in a sub-directory of the <code>themes/</code> directory. If you do, then you must always tell Hugo where to search for the skin. It’s extra work, though, so why bother with it?</p>
<p>The difference between creating a skin in <code>layouts/</code> and creating it in <code>themes/</code> is very subtle. A skin in <code>layouts/</code> can’t be customized without updating the templates and static files that it is built from. A skin created in <code>themes/</code>, on the other hand, can be and that makes it easier for other people to use it.</p>
<p>The rest of this tutorial will call a skin created in the <code>themes/</code> directory a theme.</p>
<p>Note that you can use this tutorial to create a skin in the <code>layouts/</code> directory if you wish to. The main difference will be that you won’t need to update the site’s configuration file to use a theme.</p>
<h3 id="the-home-page">The Home Page</h3>
<p>The home page, or landing page, is the first page that many visitors to a site see. It is the index.html file in the root directory of the web site. Since Hugo writes files to the public/ directory, our home page is public/index.html.</p>
<h3 id="site-configuration-file">Site Configuration File</h3>
<p>When Hugo runs, it looks for a configuration file that contains settings that override default values for the entire site. The file can use TOML, YAML, or JSON. I prefer to use TOML for my configuration files. If you prefer to use JSON or YAML, you’ll need to translate my examples. You’ll also need to change the name of the file since Hugo uses the extension to determine how to process it.</p>
<p>Hugo translates Markdown files into HTML. By default, Hugo expects to find Markdown files in your <code>content/</code> directory and template files in your <code>themes/</code> directory. It will create HTML files in your <code>public/</code> directory. You can change this by specifying alternate locations in the configuration file.</p>
<h3 id="content">Content</h3>
<p>Content is stored in text files that contain two sections. The first section is the “front matter,” which is the meta-information on the content. The second section contains Markdown that will be converted to HTML.</p>
<h4 id="front-matter">Front Matter</h4>
<p>The front matter is information about the content. Like the configuration file, it can be written in TOML, YAML, or JSON. Unlike the configuration file, Hugo doesn’t use the file’s extension to know the format. It looks for markers to signal the type. TOML is surrounded by “<code>+++</code>”, YAML by “<code>---</code>”, and JSON is enclosed in curly braces. I prefer to use TOML, so you’ll need to translate my examples if you prefer YAML or JSON.</p>
<p>The information in the front matter is passed into the template before the content is rendered into HTML.</p>
<h4 id="markdown">Markdown</h4>
<p>Content is written in Markdown which makes it easier to create the content. Hugo runs the content through a Markdown engine to create the HTML which will be written to the output file.</p>
<h3 id="template-files">Template Files</h3>
<p>Hugo uses template files to render content into HTML. Template files are a bridge between the content and presentation. Rules in the template define what content is published, where it&rsquo;s published to, and how it will rendered to the HTML file. The template guides the presentation by specifying the style to use.</p>
<p>There are three types of templates: single, list, and partial. Each type takes a bit of content as input and transforms it based on the commands in the template.</p>
<p>Hugo uses its knowledge of the content to find the template file used to render the content. If it can’t find a template that is an exact match for the content, it will shift up a level and search from there. It will continue to do so until it finds a matching template or runs out of templates to try. If it can’t find a template, it will use the default template for the site.</p>
<p>Please note that you can use the front matter to influence Hugo’s choice of templates.</p>
<h4 id="single-template">Single Template</h4>
<p>A single template is used to render a single piece of content. For example, an article or post would be a single piece of content and use a single template.</p>
<h4 id="list-template">List Template</h4>
<p>A list template renders a group of related content. That could be a summary of recent postings or all articles in a category. List templates can contain multiple groups.</p>
<p>The homepage template is a special type of list template. Hugo assumes that the home page of your site will act as the portal for the rest of the content in the site.</p>
<h4 id="partial-template">Partial Template</h4>
<p>A partial template is a template that can be included in other templates. Partial templates must be called using the “partial” template command. They are very handy for rolling up common behavior. For example, your site may have a banner that all pages use. Instead of copying the text of the banner into every single and list template, you could create a partial with the banner in it. That way if you decide to change the banner, you only have to change the partial template.</p>
<h2 id="create-a-new-site">Create a New Site</h2>
<p>Let&rsquo;s use Hugo to create a new web site. I&rsquo;m a Mac user, so I&rsquo;ll create mine in my home directory, in the Sites folder. If you&rsquo;re using Linux, you might have to create the folder first.</p>
<p>The &ldquo;new site&rdquo; command will create a skeleton of a site. It will give you the basic directory structure and a useable configuration file.</p>
<pre><code>$ hugo new site ~/Sites/zafta
$ cd ~/Sites/zafta

<p>The other directories (archetypes/, layouts/, and static/) are used when customizing a theme. That&rsquo;s a topic for a different tutorial, so please ignore them for now.</p>
<h3 id="generate-the-html-for-the-new-site">Generate the HTML For the New Site</h3>
<p>Running the <code>hugo</code> command with no options will read all the available content and generate the HTML files. It will also copy all static files (that&rsquo;s everything that&rsquo;s not content). Since we have an empty site, it won&rsquo;t do much, but it will do it very quickly.</p>

</code></pre><p>The &ldquo;<code>--verbose</code>&rdquo; flag gives extra information that will be helpful when we build the template. Every line of the output that starts with &ldquo;INFO:&rdquo; or &ldquo;WARN:&rdquo; is present because we used that flag. The lines that start with &ldquo;WARN:&rdquo; are warning messages. We&rsquo;ll go over them later.</p>
<p>We can verify that the command worked by looking at the directory again.</p>

</code></pre><p>See that new public/ directory? Hugo placed all generated content there. When you&rsquo;re ready to publish your web site, that&rsquo;s the place to start. For now, though, let&rsquo;s just confirm that we have what we&rsquo;d expect from a site with no content.</p>
<pre><code>$ ls -l public

<h3 id="test-the-new-site">Test the New Site</h3>
<p>Verify that you can run the built-in web server. It will dramatically shorten your development cycle if you do. Start it by running the &ldquo;server&rdquo; command. If it is successful, you will see output similar to the following:</p>
<pre><code>$ hugo server --verbose

</code></pre><p>Connect to the listed URL (it&rsquo;s on the line that starts with &ldquo;Web Server&rdquo;). If everything is working correctly, you should get a page that shows the following:</p>
<pre><code>index.xml
sitemap.xml
</code></pre><p>That&rsquo;s a listing of your public/ directory. Hugo didn&rsquo;t create a home page because our site has no content. When there&rsquo;s no index.html file in a directory, the server lists the files in the directory, which is what you should see in your browser.</p>
<p>Let’s go back and look at those warnings again.</p>
<pre><code>WARN: 2014/09/29 Unable to locate layout: [index.html _default/list.html _default/single.html]
WARN: 2014/09/29 Unable to locate layout: [404.html]
</code></pre><p>That second warning is easier to explain. We haven’t created a template to be used to generate “page not found errors.” The 404 message is a topic for a separate tutorial.</p>
<p>Now for the first warning. It is for the home page. You can tell because the first layout that it looked for was “index.html.” That’s only used by the home page.</p>
<p>I like that the verbose flag causes Hugo to list the files that it&rsquo;s searching for. For the home page, they are index.html, _default/list.html, and _default/single.html. There are some rules that we&rsquo;ll cover later that explain the names and paths. For now, just remember that Hugo couldn&rsquo;t find a template for the home page and it told you so.</p>
<p>At this point, you&rsquo;ve got a working installation and site that we can build upon. All that’s left is to add some content and a theme to display it.</p>
<h2 id="create-a-new-theme">Create a New Theme</h2>
<p>Hugo doesn&rsquo;t ship with a default theme. There are a few available (I counted a dozen when I first installed Hugo) and Hugo comes with a command to create new themes.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re going to create a new theme called &ldquo;zafta.&rdquo; Since the goal of this tutorial is to show you how to fill out the files to pull in your content, the theme will not contain any CSS. In other words, ugly but functional.</p>
<p>All themes have opinions on content and layout. For example, Zafta uses &ldquo;post&rdquo; over &ldquo;blog&rdquo;. Strong opinions make for simpler templates but differing opinions make it tougher to use themes. When you build a theme, consider using the terms that other themes do.</p>
<h3 id="create-a-skeleton">Create a Skeleton</h3>
<p>Use the hugo &ldquo;new&rdquo; command to create the skeleton of a theme. This creates the directory structure and places empty files for you to fill out.</p>
<pre><code>$ hugo new theme zafta

<p>Now that we&rsquo;ve got a theme to work with, it&rsquo;s a good idea to add the theme name to the configuration file. This is optional, because you can always add &ldquo;-t zafta&rdquo; on all your commands. I like to put it the configuration file because I like shorter command lines. If you don&rsquo;t put it in the configuration file or specify it on the command line, you won&rsquo;t use the template that you&rsquo;re expecting to.</p>
<p>Edit the file to add the theme, add a title for the site, and specify that all of our content will use the TOML format.</p>
<pre><code>$ vi config.toml

<ol>
<li>Hugo created a home page. This is the file public/index.html.</li>
<li>Hugo created a css/ directory.</li>
<li>Hugo created a js/ directory.</li>
<li>Hugo claimed that it created 0 pages. It created a file and copied over static files, but didn&rsquo;t create any pages. That&rsquo;s because it considers a &ldquo;page&rdquo; to be a file created directly from a content file. It doesn&rsquo;t count things like the index.html files that it creates automatically.</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="the-home-page-1">The Home Page</h4>
<p>Hugo supports many different types of templates. The home page is special because it gets its own type of template and its own template file. The file, layouts/index.html, is used to generate the HTML for the home page. The Hugo documentation says that this is the only required template, but that depends. Hugo&rsquo;s warning message shows that it looks for three different templates:</p>
<pre><code>WARN: 2014/09/29 Unable to locate layout: [index.html _default/list.html _default/single.html]
</code></pre><p>If it can&rsquo;t find any of these, it completely skips creating the home page. We noticed that when we built the site without having a theme installed.</p>
<p>When Hugo created our theme, it created an empty home page template. Now, when we build the site, Hugo finds the template and uses it to generate the HTML for the home page. Since the template file is empty, the HTML file is empty, too. If the template had any rules in it, then Hugo would have used them to generate the home page.</p>

$ 
</code></pre><h4 id="the-magic-of-static">The Magic of Static</h4>
<p>Hugo does two things when generating the site. It uses templates to transform content into HTML and it copies static files into the site. Unlike content, static files are not transformed. They are copied exactly as they are.</p>
<p>Hugo assumes that your site will use both CSS and JavaScript, so it creates directories in your theme to hold them. Remember opinions? Well, Hugo&rsquo;s opinion is that you&rsquo;ll store your CSS in a directory named css/ and your JavaScript in a directory named js/. If you don&rsquo;t like that, you can change the directory names in your theme directory or even delete them completely. Hugo&rsquo;s nice enough to offer its opinion, then behave nicely if you disagree.</p>

<ol>
<li>Purge the public/ directory.</li>
<li>Run the built in web server in watch mode.</li>
<li>Open your site in a browser.</li>
<li>Update the theme.</li>
<li>Glance at your browser window to see changes.</li>
<li>Return to step 4.</li>
</ol>
<p>I’ll throw in one more opinion: never work on a theme on a live site. Always work on a copy of your site. Make changes to your theme, test them, then copy them up to your site. For added safety, use a tool like Git to keep a revision history of your content and your theme. Believe me when I say that it is too easy to lose both your mind and your changes.</p>
<p>Check the main Hugo site for information on using Git with Hugo.</p>
<h3 id="purge-the-public-directory">Purge the public/ Directory</h3>
<p>When generating the site, Hugo will create new files and update existing ones in the <code>public/</code> directory. It will not delete files that are no longer used. For example, files that were created in the wrong directory or with the wrong title will remain. If you leave them, you might get confused by them later. I recommend cleaning out your site prior to generating it.</p>
<p>Note: If you&rsquo;re building on an SSD, you should ignore this. Churning on a SSD can be costly.</p>
<h3 id="hugos-watch-option">Hugo&rsquo;s Watch Option</h3>
<p>Hugo&rsquo;s &ldquo;<code>--watch</code>&rdquo; option will monitor the content/ and your theme directories for changes and rebuild the site automatically.</p>
<h3 id="live-reload">Live Reload</h3>
<p>Hugo&rsquo;s built in web server supports live reload. As pages are saved on the server, the browser is told to refresh the page. Usually, this happens faster than you can say, &ldquo;Wow, that&rsquo;s totally amazing.&rdquo;</p>
<h3 id="development-commands">Development Commands</h3>
<p>Use the following commands as the basis for your workflow.</p>
<pre><code>## purge old files. hugo will recreate the public directory.
##
$ rm -rf public
##
## run hugo in watch mode
##
$ hugo server --watch --verbose
</code></pre><p>Here&rsquo;s sample output showing Hugo detecting a change to the template for the home page. Once generated, the web browser automatically reloaded the page. I&rsquo;ve said this before, it&rsquo;s amazing.</p>

</code></pre><h2 id="update-the-home-page-template">Update the Home Page Template</h2>
<p>The home page is one of a few special pages that Hugo creates automatically. As mentioned earlier, it looks for one of three files in the theme&rsquo;s layout/ directory:</p>
<ol>
<li>index.html</li>
<li>_default/list.html</li>
<li>_default/single.html</li>
</ol>
<p>We could update one of the default templates, but a good design decision is to update the most specific template available. That&rsquo;s not a hard and fast rule (in fact, we&rsquo;ll break it a few times in this tutorial), but it is a good generalization.</p>
<h3 id="make-a-static-home-page">Make a Static Home Page</h3>
<p>Right now, that page is empty because we don&rsquo;t have any content and we don&rsquo;t have any logic in the template. Let&rsquo;s change that by adding some text to the template.</p>
<pre><code>$ vi themes/zafta/layouts/index.html

        + 'script&gt;')&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/body&gt; 
&lt;/html&gt;
</code></pre><p>When you use <code>--watch</code>, the Live Reload script is added by Hugo. Look for live reload in the documentation to see what it does and how to disable it.</p>
<h3 id="build-a-dynamic-home-page">Build a &ldquo;Dynamic&rdquo; Home Page</h3>
<p>&ldquo;Dynamic home page?&rdquo; Hugo&rsquo;s a static web site generator, so this seems an odd thing to say. I mean let&rsquo;s have the home page automatically reflect the content in the site every time Hugo builds it. We&rsquo;ll use iteration in the template to do that.</p>
<h4 id="create-new-posts">Create New Posts</h4>
<p>Now that we have the home page generating static content, let&rsquo;s add some content to the site. We&rsquo;ll display these posts as a list on the home page and on their own page, too.</p>
<p>Hugo has a command to generate a skeleton post, just like it does for sites and themes.</p>
<pre><code>$ hugo --verbose new post/first.md

$ 
</code></pre><p>That wasn&rsquo;t very nice, was it?</p>
<p>The &ldquo;new&rdquo; command uses an archetype to create the post file. Hugo created an empty default archetype file, but that causes an error when there&rsquo;s a theme. For me, the workaround was to create an archetypes file specifically for the post type.</p>

$
</code></pre><p>The new files are empty because because the templates used to generate the content are empty. The homepage doesn&rsquo;t show the new content, either. We have to update the templates to add the posts.</p>
<h3 id="list-and-single-templates">List and Single Templates</h3>
<p>In Hugo, we have three major kinds of templates. There&rsquo;s the home page template that we updated previously. It is used only by the home page. We also have &ldquo;single&rdquo; templates which are used to generate output for a single content file. We also have &ldquo;list&rdquo; templates that are used to group multiple pieces of content before generating output.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, list templates are named &ldquo;list.html&rdquo; and single templates are named &ldquo;single.html.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There are three other types of templates: partials, content views, and terms. We will not go into much detail on these.</p>
<h3 id="add-content-to-the-homepage">Add Content to the Homepage</h3>
<p>The home page will contain a list of posts. Let&rsquo;s update its template to add the posts that we just created. The logic in the template will run every time we build the site.</p>
<pre><code>$ vi themes/zafta/layouts/index.html 
&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
  {{ range first 10 .Data.Pages }}
    &lt;h1&gt;{{ .Title }}&lt;/h1&gt;
  {{ end }}
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
:wq

$
</code></pre><p>Hugo uses the Go template engine. That engine scans the template files for commands which are enclosed between &ldquo;{{&rdquo; and &ldquo;}}&rdquo;. In our template, the commands are:</p>
<ol>
<li>range</li>
<li>.Title</li>
<li>end</li>
</ol>
<p>The &ldquo;range&rdquo; command is an iterator. We&rsquo;re going to use it to go through the first ten pages. Every HTML file that Hugo creates is treated as a page, so looping through the list of pages will look at every file that will be created.</p>
<p>The &ldquo;.Title&rdquo; command prints the value of the &ldquo;title&rdquo; variable. Hugo pulls it from the front matter in the Markdown file.</p>
<p>The &ldquo;end&rdquo; command signals the end of the range iterator. The engine loops back to the top of the iteration when it finds &ldquo;end.&rdquo; Everything between the &ldquo;range&rdquo; and &ldquo;end&rdquo; is evaluated every time the engine goes through the iteration. In this file, that would cause the title from the first ten pages to be output as heading level one.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s helpful to remember that some variables, like .Data, are created before any output files. Hugo loads every content file into the variable and then gives the template a chance to process before creating the HTML files.</p>
<p>Build the web site and then verify the results.</p>

</code></pre><p>Congratulations, the home page shows the title of the two posts. The posts themselves are still empty, but let&rsquo;s take a moment to appreciate what we&rsquo;ve done. Your template now generates output dynamically. Believe it or not, by inserting the range command inside of those curly braces, you&rsquo;ve learned everything you need to know to build a theme. All that&rsquo;s really left is understanding which template will be used to generate each content file and becoming familiar with the commands for the template engine.</p>
<p>And, if that were entirely true, this tutorial would be much shorter. There are a few things to know that will make creating a new template much easier. Don&rsquo;t worry, though, that&rsquo;s all to come.</p>
<h3 id="add-content-to-the-posts">Add Content to the Posts</h3>
<p>We&rsquo;re working with posts, which are in the content/post/ directory. That means that their section is &ldquo;post&rdquo; (and if we don&rsquo;t do something weird, their type is also &ldquo;post&rdquo;).</p>
<p>Hugo uses the section and type to find the template file for every piece of content. Hugo will first look for a template file that matches the section or type name. If it can&rsquo;t find one, then it will look in the _default/ directory. There are some twists that we&rsquo;ll cover when we get to categories and tags, but for now we can assume that Hugo will try post/single.html, then _default/single.html.</p>
<p>Now that we know the search rule, let&rsquo;s see what we actually have available:</p>
<pre><code>$ find themes/zafta -name single.html | xargs ls -l
-rw-r--r--  1 quoha  staff  132 Sep 29 17:31 themes/zafta/layouts/_default/single.html
</code></pre><p>We could create a new template, post/single.html, or change the default. Since we don&rsquo;t know of any other content types, let&rsquo;s start with updating the default.</p>
<p>Remember, any content that we haven&rsquo;t created a template for will end up using this template. That can be good or bad. Bad because I know that we&rsquo;re going to be adding different types of content and we&rsquo;re going to end up undoing some of the changes we&rsquo;ve made. It&rsquo;s good because we&rsquo;ll be able to see immediate results. It&rsquo;s also good to start here because we can start to build the basic layout for the site. As we add more content types, we&rsquo;ll refactor this file and move logic around. Hugo makes that fairly painless, so we&rsquo;ll accept the cost and proceed.</p>
<p>Please see the Hugo documentation on template rendering for all the details on determining which template to use. And, as the docs mention, if you&rsquo;re building a single page application (SPA) web site, you can delete all of the other templates and work with just the default single page. That&rsquo;s a refreshing amount of joy right there.</p>
<h4 id="update-the-template-file">Update the Template File</h4>
<pre><code>$ vi themes/zafta/layouts/_default/single.html 
&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
  &lt;title&gt;{{ .Title }}&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;

</code></pre><p>Notice that the page wasn&rsquo;t created at the top level. It was created in a sub-directory named &lsquo;about-time/&rsquo;. That name came from our slug. Hugo will use the slug to name the generated content. It&rsquo;s a reasonable default, by the way, but we can learn a few things by fighting it for this file.</p>
<p>One other thing. Take a look at the home page.</p>
<pre><code>$ cat public/index.html

</code></pre><p>Notice that the &ldquo;about&rdquo; link is listed with the posts? That&rsquo;s not desirable, so let&rsquo;s change that first.</p>
<pre><code>$ vi themes/zafta/layouts/index.html

</code></pre><p>Knowing that hugo is using the slug to generate the file name, the simplest solution is to change the slug. Let&rsquo;s do it the hard way and change the permalink in the configuration file.</p>
<pre><code>$ vi config.toml
[permalinks]
	page = &quot;/:title/&quot;
	about = &quot;/:filename/&quot;
</code></pre><p>Generate the web site and verify that this didn&rsquo;t work. Hugo lets &ldquo;slug&rdquo; or &ldquo;URL&rdquo; override the permalinks setting in the configuration file. Go ahead and comment out the slug in content/about.md, then generate the web site to get it to be created in the right place.</p>
<h2 id="sharing-templates">Sharing Templates</h2>
<p>If you&rsquo;ve been following along, you probably noticed that posts have titles in the browser and the home page doesn&rsquo;t. That&rsquo;s because we didn&rsquo;t put the title in the home page&rsquo;s template (layouts/index.html). That&rsquo;s an easy thing to do, but let&rsquo;s look at a different option.</p>
<p>We can put the common bits into a shared template that&rsquo;s stored in the themes/zafta/layouts/partials/ directory.</p>
<h3 id="create-the-header-and-footer-partials">Create the Header and Footer Partials</h3>
<p>In Hugo, a partial is a sugar-coated template. Normally a template reference has a path specified. Partials are different. Hugo searches for them along a TODO defined search path. This makes it easier for end-users to override the theme&rsquo;s presentation.</p>
<pre><code>$ vi themes/zafta/layouts/partials/header.html
&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
	&lt;title&gt;{{ .Title }}&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
:wq

$ vi themes/zafta/layouts/partials/footer.html
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
:wq
</code></pre><h3 id="update-the-home-page-template-to-use-the-partials">Update the Home Page Template to Use the Partials</h3>
<p>The most noticeable difference between a template call and a partials call is the lack of path:</p>
<pre><code>{{ template &quot;theme/partials/header.html&quot; . }}
</code></pre><p>versus</p>
<pre><code>{{ partial &quot;header.html&quot; . }}
</code></pre><p>Both pass in the context.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s change the home page template to use these new partials.</p>
<pre><code>$ vi themes/zafta/layouts/index.html
{{ partial &quot;header.html&quot; . }}

  &lt;h1&gt;posts&lt;/h1&gt;
  {{ range first 10 .Data.Pages }}
    {{ if eq .Type &quot;post&quot;}}
      &lt;h2&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;{{ .Permalink }}&quot;&gt;{{ .Title }}&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
    {{ end }}
  {{ end }}

  &lt;h1&gt;pages&lt;/h1&gt;
  {{ range .Data.Pages }}
    {{ if or (eq .Type &quot;page&quot;) (eq .Type &quot;about&quot;) }}
      &lt;h2&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;{{ .Permalink }}&quot;&gt;{{ .Type }} - {{ .Title }} - {{ .RelPermalink }}&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
    {{ end }}
  {{ end }}

{{ partial &quot;footer.html&quot; . }}
:wq
</code></pre><p>Generate the web site and verify the results. The title on the home page is now &ldquo;your title here&rdquo;, which comes from the &ldquo;title&rdquo; variable in the config.toml file.</p>
<h3 id="update-the-default-single-template-to-use-the-partials">Update the Default Single Template to Use the Partials</h3>
<pre><code>$ vi themes/zafta/layouts/_default/single.html
{{ partial &quot;header.html&quot; . }}

  &lt;h1&gt;{{ .Title }}&lt;/h1&gt;
  {{ .Content }}

{{ partial &quot;footer.html&quot; . }}
:wq
</code></pre><p>Generate the web site and verify the results. The title on the posts and the about page should both reflect the value in the markdown file.</p>
<h2 id="add-date-published-to-posts">Add “Date Published” to Posts</h2>
<p>It&rsquo;s common to have posts display the date that they were written or published, so let&rsquo;s add that. The front matter of our posts has a variable named &ldquo;date.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s usually the date the content was created, but let&rsquo;s pretend that&rsquo;s the value we want to display.</p>
<h3 id="add-date-published-to-the-template">Add “Date Published” to the Template</h3>
<p>We&rsquo;ll start by updating the template used to render the posts. The template code will look like:</p>
<pre><code>{{ .Date.Format &quot;Mon, Jan 2, 2006&quot; }}
</code></pre><p>Posts use the default single template, so we&rsquo;ll change that file.</p>
<pre><code>$ vi themes/zafta/layouts/_default/single.html
{{ partial &quot;header.html&quot; . }}

  &lt;h1&gt;{{ .Title }}&lt;/h1&gt;
  &lt;h2&gt;{{ .Date.Format &quot;Mon, Jan 2, 2006&quot; }}&lt;/h2&gt;
  {{ .Content }}

{{ partial &quot;footer.html&quot; . }}
:wq
</code></pre><p>Generate the web site and verify the results. The posts now have the date displayed in them. There&rsquo;s a problem, though. The &ldquo;about&rdquo; page also has the date displayed.</p>
<p>As usual, there are a couple of ways to make the date display only on posts. We could do an &ldquo;if&rdquo; statement like we did on the home page. Another way would be to create a separate template for posts.</p>
<p>The &ldquo;if&rdquo; solution works for sites that have just a couple of content types. It aligns with the principle of &ldquo;code for today,&rdquo; too.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s assume, though, that we&rsquo;ve made our site so complex that we feel we have to create a new template type. In Hugo-speak, we&rsquo;re going to create a section template.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s restore the default single template before we forget.</p>
<pre><code>$ mkdir themes/zafta/layouts/post
$ vi themes/zafta/layouts/_default/single.html
{{ partial &quot;header.html&quot; . }}

  &lt;h1&gt;{{ .Title }}&lt;/h1&gt;
  {{ .Content }}

{{ partial &quot;footer.html&quot; . }}
:wq
</code></pre><p>Now we&rsquo;ll update the post&rsquo;s version of the single template. If you remember Hugo&rsquo;s rules, the template engine will use this version over the default.</p>
<pre><code>$ vi themes/zafta/layouts/post/single.html
{{ partial &quot;header.html&quot; . }}

  &lt;h1&gt;{{ .Title }}&lt;/h1&gt;
  &lt;h2&gt;{{ .Date.Format &quot;Mon, Jan 2, 2006&quot; }}&lt;/h2&gt;
  {{ .Content }}

{{ partial &quot;footer.html&quot; . }}
:wq

</code></pre><p>Note that we removed the date logic from the default template and put it in the post template. Generate the web site and verify the results. Posts have dates and the about page doesn&rsquo;t.</p>
<h3 id="dont-repeat-yourself">Don&rsquo;t Repeat Yourself</h3>
<p>DRY is a good design goal and Hugo does a great job supporting it. Part of the art of a good template is knowing when to add a new template and when to update an existing one. While you&rsquo;re figuring that out, accept that you&rsquo;ll be doing some refactoring. Hugo makes that easy and fast, so it&rsquo;s okay to delay splitting up a template.</p>

<h2 id="the-figure-shortcode">The &ldquo;figure&rdquo; Shortcode</h2>
<p>Hugo has <code>figure</code> shortcode built in, so you can easily add figcaptions or hyperlink rel attributes to images. Documentations can be found here:</p>
<p><a href="https://gohugo.io/content-management/shortcodes/#figure">https://gohugo.io/content-management/shortcodes/#figure</a></p>
<p>This theme has 3 CSS classes made for figure elements:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>big</code>: images will break the width limit of main content area.</li>
<li><code>left</code>: images will float to the left.</li>
<li><code>right</code>: images will float to the right.</li>
</ul>
<p>If a figure has no class set, the image will behave just like a normal markdown image: <code>![]()</code>.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s some examples, please be aware that these styles only take effect when the page width is over 1300px.</p>
